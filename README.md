# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction
Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs the nervous system and the bodily functions regulated by it. The symptoms of this condition can be subtle and may not be immediately apparent. However, characteristic signs such as muscle rigidity, tremors, and slowed movement may indicate the presence of Parkinson's disease.
