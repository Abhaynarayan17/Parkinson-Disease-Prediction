# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction
Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs the nervous system and the bodily functions regulated by it. The symptoms of this condition can be subtle and may not be immediately apparent. However, characteristic signs such as muscle rigidity, tremors, and slowed movement may indicate the presence of Parkinson's disease.
Predicting Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning in Python

Importing Essential Libraries and Dataset

To predict Parkinson's disease, we'll use Python libraries, which simplify data handling and complex tasks with concise code.

Key Libraries:

Pandas: Enables efficient data loading and analysis through 2D data frames, offering a range of functions for streamlined processing.
NumPy: Provides fast and efficient numerical computations, ideal for large-scale calculations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualizes data insights through informative plots and charts.
Scikit-learn (Sklearn): Offers a comprehensive suite of libraries for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation, covering the entire machine learning workflow.
XGBoost: Implements the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, renowned for achieving high accuracy in predictions.
Imbalanced-learn (Imblearn): Addresses data imbalance issues with specialized functions, ensuring more reliable model performance.
These libraries will form the foundation of our Parkinson's disease prediction model, enabling us to extract insights and make accurate predictions.
